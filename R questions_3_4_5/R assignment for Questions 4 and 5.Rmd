This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

# Question 3 - Considering the R code: cumsum(rnorm(100)) how would you describe the data being generated.
# - I would describe the data as being a series of 100 random numbers that is the cumulatively summed with the cumsum funciton


# Question 4 - visualize the R code chunk to aid in a description of what it is doing

N <-512
inds <- c(8,16)
b <- 30
a <- 128
s <- rnorm(N)
x <- fft(s)
logind <- rep(FALSE, N/2-1)
logind[inds] <- TRUE
logind <- c(FALSE, logind, FALSE, rev(logind))

x[logind]<-b*x[logind]
y<-Re(fft(x, inverse = TRUE)/length(x))

result<-ts(y/sd(y), frequency = a)


# the initial lines are defining the variables N, inds, b, a, s, and x
# the rnorm function that s is set to isn’t locked in with a seed so it #effectively generates 512 new numbers everytime the code is executed
# x is then set to the fast fourier transform of that series of #randomly generated values and converts the random series of values into #a frequency plot
# then, finally, the time seriess function plots the standardized ‘y’ #data since ‘y’ returns a non- normalized transform of the series of #values which can be seen in the visual below
plot(result)

# Question 5 - build out a predictive prgram for the df data and use the program to predict "c"

#visualize the df
df <- data.frame(a = c(rnorm(80), rnorm(20,1,2))
                 
                 , b = c(rnorm(80,0,3), rnorm(20,2,2))
                 , c = c(rep(TRUE,80), rep(FALSE,20)))

df
plot(df)

# write a function to split the data into test and train set
test_train_split = function(data, test_size=.25){
    
    # the the number of observations in the data
    n_obs = dim(df)[1]
    
    # find the number of training observations by rounding up
    n_train_obs = ceiling(n_obs * (1 - test_size))
    
    # get the train indexes
    train_idx = sample(n_obs, n_train_obs)
    
    # split the data
    train = data[train_idx, ]
    test = data[-train_idx, ]

    # return the result
    result = list(train, test)
    return(result)
}

# write a function to calculate the MSE
calc_MSE = function (model, data){
    return (
        mean((data$c - predict(model, data)) ^ 2)
    )
}

set.seed(42)
result = test_train_split(df, test_size = .25)
train_data = data.frame(result[1])
test_data = data.frame(result[2])

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
